            <h3>I'm Smokey</h3>   
            <p>This cat is a Siamese mix, and the Siamese cat is a species that forms a close bond with its owner. As a result, they want to be with their owners for a long time; otherwise, they may be stressed out and suffer from depression or separation anxiety. Siamese cats are brilliant and energetic, so their owners must play with them for a long time. For example, playing with food, puzzles, or toys is good. It is also suitable for people with cat hair allergies. Siamese cats release shallow levels of the glycoprotein Feld 1, a protein that causes allergic reactions to cat hair, and they are also good for raising them in people with allergies. Among them, female Siamese cats secrete less than male cats.</p>
