                        <p>
                            Taking care of a cat is more than just providing food and water. Let me tell you some things that make your cat friend stay healthy and happy. 

                            As an essential requirement, we provide cat food that matches your cat's age, health, and activity level. Expensive food is not the only answer. Surprisingly, cats have picky tastes, and it can be challenging to find the right one, so you need to know what kind of food your cat prefers, not just by looking at the price. Also, since cats always prefer fresh and clean water, we recommend using cat fountains to encourage drinking water.

                            Mother cats provide the nutrition, immunity, and social skills that kittens need to start healthy lives. An annual checkup is essential to monitor your cat's health by visiting regular veterinarians and to detect potential problems early. Ensure you get vaccinated and continue with your core vaccinations, such as rabies or cat disinfectants. Keeping them home won't help avoid fleas, ticks, and bugs. Use the treatments your veterinarian recommends for this.
                            Neutering surgery helps prevent health problems and unwanted filth.
